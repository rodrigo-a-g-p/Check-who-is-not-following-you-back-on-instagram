# Check who is not following you back on Instagram


#### I wrote this very short script just to have a quick way of finding out who is not following me back on insta (so I could not follow them back, very petty, indeed).
#### Previously, I used third-party apps check the former, but they stopped working for some reason; I tried installing new apps, but these were behind a pay-wall. Therefore, I decide to place the matter into my own hands.

#### This script uses the account data supplied by Instagram; when you ask Instagram for your account data, and Instagram asks you to choose the file type, you must choose JSON file type for this script to work.

#### This is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq5auAxdDvY&t=48s) to a YouTube video that will show you how to request your account data to Instagram.

#### Cheers!
